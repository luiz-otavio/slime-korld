# STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
This library is still in development and should not be used in production.
Since I'm so tired of writing documentation, I'm going to write it in markdown.

Bukkit library written to implement the Slime World Format from Hypixel.

## Overview
Slime Korld is a library that allows you to create Slime Worlds in a Minecraft Server.
It introduce the right format of the slime format with extra data features and a simple API.

## Hypixel Slime
Since July of 2019, Hypixel has started using Slime World Format to store their skyblocks islands with less data in dedicated environments for storage.
This library tries to support this format as well and try to make it easier to use.
As we know, Anvil Format saves a lot of useless information for unique and small worlds which is used to mini-games and other things.

`"Slime fixes the points outlined above, while sticking to a lot of Minecraft "standards", sometimes so software compatibility is easier, sometimes for performance."` - Hypixel DevBlog #5.
